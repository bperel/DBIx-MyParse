Version 0.85

* Autogenerated column alias are no longer returned to the caller, only genuine "AS alias" are.

* SQL_CACHE takes precedence over SQL_NO_CACHE when print()-ing a query, because SQL_NO_CACHE may be added automatically

* Made note in the documentation that SQL_NO_CACHE can appear even if it was not specifed in the SQL, if the SQL contains
uncachable constructs.
