DBIx::MyParse version 0.20
====================

This module provides access to the MySQL SQL parser.

INSTALLATION

A binary RPM built using cpan2rpm on a Fedora Core 6 is available from http://www.sf.net/projects/myparse. To compile
the module from scratch please do the following:

A. Prepare your MySQL source

1. Download the latest 5.0 MySQL source from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html and unzip it

2. Apply the patch

	# cd /usr/src/your-mysql-source
	# cat /usr/src/DBIx-MyParse/mysql.patch | patch -p1

3. Configure the MySQL source

	# cd /usr/src/your-mysql-source
	# ./configure --with-embedded-server
	# make

You do NOT need to do "make install". This way, any other MySQL installations that you have will
not be overwritten. You only need to have a populated /usr/local/share/mysql/ directory (containing errmsg.txt).

If you do not have it, do:

	# cd /usr/src/your-mysql-source
	# cd sql/share
	# make instal

B. Install DBIx::MyParse

	# perl Makefile.PL
	# make install
	# mkdir /tmp/myparse
	# mkdir /tmp/myparse/test
	# make test

You will need to create /tmp/myparse and /tmp/myparse/test to run the test suite.

POTENTIAL ISSUES

If you get:

Can't load '/proj/myparse/blib/arch/auto/DBIx/MyParse/MyParse.so'
for module DBIx::MyParse: libz.so.0: cannot open shared object file:
No such file or directory at /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.6/i386-linux-thread-multi/DynaLoader.pm line 230.

, please try:

ln -s /usr/local/lib/mysql/libz.so.0.0.0 /usr/lib/libz.so.0

if there is no /usr/local/lib/mysql/libz.so.0.0.0, to a "make install" in the zlib directory
of the mysql source.

If you get:

051007 12:11:20 [ERROR] Can't find messagefile '/usr/local/share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys'

please try:

	# cd your-mysql-source/sql/share
	# make install

or do a complete MySQL install to get the same result

If you get:

Unable to initialize libmysqld. at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i686-linux/DBIx/MyParse.pm line 83

Please make sure you have the /usr/local/share/mysql/ directory populated, see step A.3. above.
